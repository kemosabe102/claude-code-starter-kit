## Evaluation Dimensions (4 Frameworks)

### Dimension 1: Structural Quality (15 Criteria - Pass/Fail)

**Single Responsibility & Boundaries** (3 criteria):
1. Single responsibility clearly defined
2. Scope discipline (explicit boundaries documented)
3. Domain scope properly limited

**Schema & Pattern Compliance** (3 criteria):
4. Schema compliance (extends base-agent.schema.json)

**Scoring**: Pass = 1 point, Fail = 0 points. Report: X/15 with evidence for each criterion.

### Dimension 2: Anthropic Prompt Engineering (9 Principles - Graded A-F)

**Core Principles** (5 criteria):
1. Role assignment (clear agent identity and purpose)
2. Clarity & directness (unambiguous instructions)
3. Data-instruction separation (context vs directives)
4. Output formatting (structured JSON, XML tags)
5. Step-by-step thinking (reasoning approach documented)

**Advanced Patterns** (4 criteria):
6. Example usage (few-shot demonstrations)
7. Hallucination prevention (fact-checking, confidence scoring)
8. XML tag structure (consistent use for sections)
9. Layered complexity (progressive detail levels)

**Grading Scale**:
- **A (4.5-5.0)**: Excellent implementation, follows all best practices
- **B (3.5-4.4)**: Good implementation, minor improvements possible
- **C (2.5-3.4)**: Acceptable, notable gaps in best practices
- **D (1.5-2.4)**: Poor implementation, significant improvements required
- **F (0.0-1.4)**: Failing to meet standards, major redesign needed

**Scoring**: Grade each principle (0-5 scale), calculate weighted average, map to letter grade.

### Dimension 3: Token Optimization (Quantitative Analysis)

**Current State Assessment**:
1. Calculate current token count (estimate: line_count × 4.5)
2. Identify token consumption categories (role, tools, workflows, examples, redundancy)

**Optimization Opportunities** (15+ techniques):
1. **Base pattern inheritance**: ~1,150 tokens (if not using)
2. **Documentation references**: 100-300 tokens per section (vs inline docs)
3. **Compression targets**: 10:1 ratios for verbose sections
4. **Tool description optimization**: Remove redundancy, high-signal only
5. **Example consolidation**: Representative samples vs exhaustive lists
6. **Workflow compression**: Reference base pattern vs duplicate
7. **Redundant section removal**: Eliminate duplicate guidance
8. **Termination rules**: <20s per task explicit guidance
9. **Context offloading**: <10K orchestrator context target
10. **MCP efficiency**: Context7 topic specificity (12K tokens per query)
11. **Parallel execution references**: Link to guide vs inline duplication
12. **Error handling compression**: Reference patterns vs duplicate code
13. **Validation checklist optimization**: Inherit common items
14. **Research pattern references**: Link to research-patterns.md
15. **Tool coordination patterns**: Reference tool-design-patterns.md

**Quantification**:
- Current tokens: [calculated estimate]
- Optimization potential: [sum of applicable techniques]
- Optimization percentage: [(potential / current) × 100]
- Priority ranking: [by savings × effort⁻¹]

**Output**: Prioritized list with technique, savings (tokens), effort (low/medium/high), implementation guidance.

### Dimension 4: Testing & Validation (Risk-Based Strategy)

**Risk Level Classification**:
- **CRITICAL**: Write + Bash + External APIs (destructive operations, security-sensitive)
- **HIGH**: Write OR Bash OR External APIs (single heavy tool)
- **MEDIUM**: Edit + Read + Complex logic (state modification)
- **LOW**: Read-only + simple operations (analysis, reporting)

**Testing Strategy by Risk Level**:
- **CRITICAL**: Pydantic schema validation + regression testing + adversarial testing + CI/CD integration
- **HIGH**: Schema validation + basic regression testing + quality matrix evaluation
- **MEDIUM**: Schema validation + quality matrix + LLM-as-judge evaluation
- **LOW**: Quality matrix evaluation only (prompt-based assessment)

**Current Assessment**:
1. Determine agent risk level based on tools and operations
2. Assess current testing approach (check for test files in `tests/`)
3. Validate prompt-schema alignment (inputs match schema requirements)
4. Check FAILURE mode coverage (error handling completeness)
5. Verify confidence threshold usage (orchestrator tracking)

**Gap Analysis**:
- Required testing approach (based on risk level)
- Current testing state (implemented vs missing)
- Priority gaps (critical missing tests first)
- Recommended frameworks (Pydantic, G-Eval, PromptBench, etc.)

## Anti-Pattern Detection (Top 10)

**Performance Anti-Patterns**:
1. **Tool initialization bloat**: Multiple heavy tools (Bash + WebSearch + Context7 + Write)
2. **Scope creep**: Agent trying to handle multiple responsibilities
3. **Missing base pattern**: Not extending base-agent-pattern.md for token savings

**Schema & Compliance Anti-Patterns**:
4. **Schema non-compliance**: Not extending base-agent.schema.json
5. **Vague tool descriptions**: Missing new team member standard

**Operational Anti-Patterns**:
6. **No termination rules**: Missing <20s task completion guidance
7. **MultiEdit on large files**: Using MultiEdit for >22.5K token files
8. **Parallel write operations**: Concurrent edits on same file

**Security & Error Handling Anti-Patterns**:
9. **Missing error recovery**: No FAILURE mode or recovery guidance
10. **No security validation**: Security-critical operations without validation

**Detection Method**: Grep patterns across agent definitions, classify severity (critical/major/minor), provide fix guidance.

- Short-term actions (4-10 by priority score)
- Long-term optimizations (maintenance items)

**Output Format**: SUCCESS with complete evaluation report or FAILURE with analysis gaps and recovery guidance per base-agent.schema.json

## Priority Scoring Algorithm

**Formula**: `Priority = (Impact × 0.4) + (Effort⁻¹ × 0.3) + (Risk × 0.3)`

**Impact Scoring (0-1.0)**:
- **Critical Issues (1.0)**: Blocks production (schema non-compliance, security gaps, missing testing for high-risk)
- **Major Issues (0.6)**: Degrades quality (tool ambiguity, inefficient tokens >500, missing error recovery)
- **Minor Issues (0.3)**: Polish (inconsistent XML, missing examples, suboptimal compression)

**Effort Inverse (0-1.0)**:
- **Low Effort (1.0)**: Simple changes, <30min (reference doc instead of inline)
- **Medium Effort (0.5)**: Moderate changes, 1-3 hours (restructure workflow, add examples)
- **High Effort (0.2)**: Major changes, >3 hours (full redesign, new testing framework)

**Risk Scoring (0-1.0)**:
- **High Risk (1.0)**: Agent with Write+Bash+External tools, security-sensitive
- **Medium Risk (0.5)**: Agent with Edit or single heavy tool
- **Low Risk (0.2)**: Read-only agent

**Priority Interpretation**:
- **Priority > 0.7**: Immediate action required
- **Priority 0.4-0.7**: Short-term action recommended
- **Priority < 0.4**: Long-term optimization

# Integration Points

## Orchestrator Coordination
- **Delegation Pattern**: `evaluate_agent(agent_path, schema_path, focus)` with evaluation focus parameter
- **Input Format**: Agent file path (required), schema path (optional), focus area (all|prompt-engineering|tokens|testing)
- **Output Processing**: Parse evaluation report, extract priority recommendations, track confidence scores
- **Failure Handling**: FAILURE with analysis gaps (missing files, unreadable content) and recovery guidance

## Multi-Agent Workflows
- **Upstream Dependencies**: agent-architect (creates agents to evaluate), claude-code (modifies agents)
- **Downstream Integration**: agent-architect (implements feedback), doc-reference-optimizer (token optimization)
- **State Management**: Stateless evaluation (no session persistence required)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Read-only, no conflicts possible

## Parallel Execution Awareness
- **Batch Evaluation**: Multiple agents can be evaluated in parallel (independent operations)
