## Universal Core Standards (Detailed)

### A) Identity & Scope

#### **1. Strict Scope + Path Validation**
Always enforce allowed directories; refuse on violation.
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.98

#### **2. Security Defaults**
No secrets; sanitize paths/inputs; minimal permissions.
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.96

### B) Workflow & Failure Mode

#### **3. 5-Phase Workflow**
Research → Plan → Patch/Execute → Evaluate → Report.
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.95

#### **4. Blocking Behavior**
If missing info: emit `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` with concrete gaps + proposed next steps.
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.95

#### **5. Structured Output (3 statuses)**
`SUCCESS | NEEDS_CLARIFICATION | ERROR` + machine-parsable + human summary.
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.97

### C) Tooling & Edits

#### **6. Tool Selection & Fallbacks**
Use Write/Edit for simple changes; **single-attempt MultiEdit → immediate versioned fallback**; no repeated MultiEdit retries.
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.94

#### **7. Research-Only External Use**
Never mutate external systems; **respect rate limits**.
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.93

### D) Documentation & Validation

#### **8. Mandatory Timestamp-First Reporting & Orchestrator Timestamp Authority**
Short executive summary + detailed markdown report (what/why/how/sources/risks).
**ORCHESTRATOR TIMESTAMP AUTHORITY (CRITICAL):**
- **Orchestrator MUST provide execution_timestamp** to all sub-agents in ISO 8601 UTC format
- **Sub-agents MUST NOT create their own timestamps** - use only orchestrator-provided timestamp
- **All timestamps MUST be consistent** across the entire orchestration session
**REQUIRED Report Naming**: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS-<agent-name>-<task-description>.md` (orchestrator timestamp MUST be first)
**Chain Format**: "At [orchestrator-timestamp], [agent], [description]" for troubleshooting sequence tracking.
**Validation**: All report paths MUST validate against pattern `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}-\d{6}-[a-z-]+-[a-z0-9-]+\.md$`
**Timestamp Source**: Only orchestrator-provided execution_timestamp - never generate locally
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.95

#### **9. Schema Validation & Traceability**
Outputs validate against per-agent schema; include sources & change tracking.
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.94

### E) Ops Hygiene

#### **10. Per-Task Failure Tracking & Self-Assessment**
**Pre-Flight Assessment (MANDATORY):**
- Agents MUST assess task complexity during pre-flight: `complexity_estimate`, `expected_changes` (can be 0), `failure_tolerance`
- No predefined minimums or maximums - agents determine appropriate thresholds based on task
- Maintain failure tracking in memory using schema: `.claude/docs/schemas/failure-tracking-memory.schema.json`

**Two-Attempt Rule (Individual Agent Tool Usage):**
- Max **2 failed attempts** per specific operation (tool + target)
- After 2 failures on same operation: try different approach or escalate
- Simple modifications only - no scope creep from original task
- **Sub-Agent Constraint**: Sub-agents cannot call other sub-agents - only orchestrator manages sub-agent delegation

**Failure Pattern Detection:**
- Track each operation attempt with tool, target, and approach used
- Escalate when failure tolerance exceeded or approaches exhausted
- Focus on failed operations only - success tracking not required

**Tier:** Major | **Confidence:** 0.91

#### **11. Escalation Strategy & Clear Next Steps**
**When to Escalate:**
- After 2 failed attempts on any single operation
- When failure tolerance (set during pre-flight) is exceeded
- When different approaches still fail within original task scope

**Escalation Actions:**
- **Ask planner agent**: For research or planning needs
- **Ask different sub-agent**: When expertise outside agent's domain needed
- **Ask human**: For decisions, clarifications, or scope changes
- **Change scope**: When original task is fundamentally blocked

**Required Escalation Information:**
- Specific operations that failed
- All approaches attempted
- Concrete next step recommendations for orchestrator
- Clear description of what help is needed

**Tier:** Major | **Confidence:** 0.89

#### **12. Confidence & Severity in Results**
Add `confidence: 0–1` and `severity: Critical|Major|Minor` to `SUCCESS` and `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` payloads (findings & recommendations).
**Tier:** Major | **Confidence:** 0.84

## Standard Output Fields

### **Always Include:**
- `status`, `agent`, `task_id`, `summary`, `report_path`, `changes[]`, `sources[]`
- `execution_timestamp` (REQUIRED - from orchestrator only, ISO 8601 UTC format)

### **If Blocked:**
- `missing[]`, `proposed_next_steps[]`

### **Ops Hygiene (Required):**
- `confidence`, `severity`, `failure_tracking` (per schema), `escalation_needed`
- `timestamp_source: "orchestrator"` (REQUIRED - validates timestamp authority)

---

## MultiEdit Fallback Protocol (Universal)

**Problem**: MultiEdit is unreliable for large or complex changes across all agents

**Universal Solution**:
1. **Single Attempt**: Try MultiEdit only once
2. **Immediate Fallback**: On any failure, switch to versioning strategy:
   - Create `[filename]-v2.[ext]` with complete new content
   - Document the fallback in detailed report
   - Include both files in changes tracking
   - Recommend orchestrator handle file replacement
3. **No Retries**: Never attempt MultiEdit multiple times - fail fast to versioning

## Mandatory Sub-Agent Completion Validation

### **13. End-of-Run Validation Checklist (CRITICAL)**

**ALL sub-agents MUST perform this validation checklist before reporting completion:**

#### **A) Task Completion Verification**
```json
{
  "task_completion_validation": {
    "original_request": "[exact task request received]",
    "intended_operations": ["list of operations agent was supposed to perform"],
    "actual_operations_performed": ["list of operations actually performed"],
    "completion_status": "COMPLETE | PARTIAL | FAILED",
    "verification_method": "file_read_back | status_check | other"
  }
}
```

#### **B) File Operation Validation (If Any File Operations Intended)**
```json
{
  "file_operation_validation": {
    "intended_file_changes": [
      {
        "file_path": "path/to/file",
        "operation_type": "create | edit | delete",
        "intended_change": "description of intended change"
      }
    ],
    "actual_file_changes": [
      {
        "file_path": "path/to/file",
        "operation_attempted": "Edit | Write | MultiEdit",
        "operation_result": "SUCCESS | FAILED | FALLBACK_USED",
        "verification_result": "CONFIRMED | NOT_VERIFIED | FAILED_VERIFICATION",
        "fallback_strategy_used": "none | versioning | alternative_approach"
      }
    ],
    "file_verification_performed": true,
    "verification_method": "read_back_modified_files"
  }
}
```

#### **C) Failure and Fallback Reporting (MANDATORY)**
```json
{
  "failure_and_fallback_reporting": {
    "any_operations_failed": true/false,
    "failed_operations": [
      {
        "operation": "description",
        "tool_used": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit|etc",
        "failure_reason": "specific error or issue",
        "fallback_applied": "versioning | alternative_tool | escalation",
        "fallback_success": true/false
      }
    ],
    "unreported_failures": false,
    "all_failures_documented": true
  }
}
```

#### **D) Self-Assessment Accuracy Check (CRITICAL)**
```json
{
  "self_assessment": {
    "task_request_interpretation": "CORRECT | MISUNDERSTOOD | PARTIALLY_UNDERSTOOD",
    "implementation_vs_analysis": "IMPLEMENTED_CHANGES | ONLY_ANALYZED | MIXED",
    "file_operations_actually_performed": true/false,
    "success_report_accuracy": "ACCURATE | OVERSTATED | UNDERSTATED",
    "ready_for_human_validation": true/false
  }
}
```

**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.99

### **14. File Operation Verification Protocol (CRITICAL)**

**When ANY file operations are intended, agents MUST:**

1. **Pre-Operation Assessment**:
   - Identify all files that should be modified
   - Choose appropriate tool strategy (Edit vs MultiEdit vs Write)
   - Apply large file protocol if applicable (skip MultiEdit, use versioning)

2. **Post-Operation Verification**:
   - Read back ALL modified files to confirm changes applied
   - Compare intended changes vs actual file content
   - Verify file existence, readability, and content accuracy

3. **Failure Documentation**:
   - Report ALL failed operations, even if fallback succeeded
   - Document specific error messages and root causes
   - Explain fallback strategies used and their success/failure

4. **Success Report Validation**:
   - Only report SUCCESS if verification confirms changes applied
   - Report PARTIAL if some but not all intended changes applied
   - Report FAILED if verification shows no changes or incorrect changes

**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.98

### **15. Implementation vs Analysis Distinction (CRITICAL)**

**Agents MUST clearly distinguish between analysis tasks and implementation tasks:**

#### **Implementation Task Indicators**:
- Context includes words: "update", "modify", "create", "implement", "change"
- Specific file paths mentioned for modification
- Expected file changes or new file creation described
- Output should be working files, not just descriptions

#### **Analysis Task Indicators**:
- Context includes words: "analyze", "review", "describe", "explain", "report on"
- Request for recommendations or design descriptions
- Output should be documentation or analysis reports

#### **When Uncertain**:
- **ASK FOR CLARIFICATION**: "This request could be interpreted as implementation or analysis. Should I: (A) Actually modify files, or (B) Provide analysis/design recommendations?"
- **Default to Implementation** if file paths are specifically mentioned
- **Include verification step** to ensure task type was correctly interpreted

**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.97

#### **16. Large File Operation Protocol (CRITICAL)**
Before ANY file operation >5K tokens:
1. **Pre-Flight Assessment**: Check file token count (use 22.5K as safety threshold)
2. **Tool Selection**: Never use MultiEdit for files >10K tokens
3. **Versioning Strategy**: Create filename-v2.ext for files >22.5K tokens
4. **Failure Documentation**: Record fallback usage and cleanup needs
**Tier:** Critical | **Confidence:** 0.98

**These detailed standards ensure consistent, reliable, and secure operation across all Claude Code agents while supporting the micro-agent architecture and read-only orchestrator pattern. The mandatory validation checklist prevents false success reporting and ensures all sub-agents accurately complete their intended tasks with proper verification and failure documentation.**
