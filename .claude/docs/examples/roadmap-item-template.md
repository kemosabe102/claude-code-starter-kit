## Template Design Principles

### **Information Hierarchy (5-Second Scan)**
1. **Header**: ID and Strategic Capability Name (unique identifier + what it does)
2. **Roadmap Item Overview Table**: Clean separation of key fields in priority order
   - **Owner**: Developer codename (accountability)
   - **Status**: Current development state (Ready/Planning/Proposed)
   - **Goal**: Strategic outcome in one line
   - **Description**: 120-character implementation details
   - **Priority**: Criticality level (P0/P1/P2)
   - **Points**: Effort estimation (1-30)
3. **Quick Value**: Immediate business impact summary

### **Ownership Requirements (Small Company Context)**
- **Owner MUST be specific codename**: "Lyken", "AlexDev", "SarahK"
- **NO generic teams**: Avoid "Core Development Team", "Engineering", "Product Team"
- **Accountability model**: Single-person ownership for clear responsibility
- **Use [NEEDS VERIFICATION - assign codename]** only when assignment genuinely unclear

### **Content Organization**
- **Quick Scan Section**: Critical info visible without scrolling (Lines 1-4)
- **Business Value**: Strategic impact bullets (VP-reportable outcomes)
- **Details Section**: Timeline, dependencies, constraints, metrics (below fold)
- **Compressed Details**: Pipe-separated lists for constraints, risks, metrics

## Readiness Validation

**Ready Status Requirements (Score â‰¥8):**
- [ ] ID and Goal clearly stated in first 2 lines
- [ ] Specific person assigned as Owner (not generic team)
- [ ] Priority/Status/Points visible in quick scan section
- [ ] One-line Quick Value statement for business impact
- [ ] 3+ Strategic Outcomes focused on measurable business results
- [ ] Dependencies resolved or explicitly managed
- [ ] Success metrics quantified or marked [NEEDS VERIFICATION]

**Roadmap Planning Focus Areas:**
- Strategic capabilities that advance business goals
- Customer outcomes suitable for stakeholder communication
- Operational metrics for executive dashboards
- Clear accountability through specific person ownership
