## **Introduction**

Context management is **crucial** for AI agents because large language models have finite memory and can become less reliable as more information accumulates in a conversation[\[1\]](https://coconote.app/notes/d9fe1ddd-906d-4d03-bca6-a43a80ef58fe#:~:text=Importance%20of%20Context%20Engineering). In complex workflows – especially involving **agent-to-agent interactions** or when calling external tools via protocols like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) – careful management of context is key. Poor context handling can lead to degraded performance (“context rot”), high costs, confusion between agents, or even security vulnerabilities. Below, we explore the main concerns around context management and how to mitigate these risks, focusing on standardized best practices (with an emphasis on Anthropic’s models and tools like FastMCP, LangGraph, and the Claude Agent SDK).

## **Key Context Management Challenges**

* **Finite Context Windows & “Context Rot”:** Every LLM has a limited context window (a maximum number of tokens it can attend to). As you add more messages, tool outputs, or history, the model’s ability to recall relevant info drops – a phenomenon known as *context rot*[\[1\]](https://coconote.app/notes/d9fe1ddd-906d-4d03-bca6-a43a80ef58fe#:~:text=Importance%20of%20Context%20Engineering). In other words, **the more you pack in, the less focus the model has per token**[\[2\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents#:~:text=Despite%20their%20speed%20and%20ability,information%20from%20that%20context%20decreases). This leads to diminishing returns: important details may be forgotten or overlooked when the context is very large[\[3\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents#:~:text=in%20the%20context%20window%20increases%2C,information%20from%20that%20context%20decreases).  
* **Context Window Limits and Overflows:** Long-running conversations or multi-step tasks can easily hit token limits, causing the agent to **fail or truncate information**[\[4\]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management#:~:text=Context%20windows%20have%20limits%2C%20but,real%20work%20doesn%E2%80%99t). Even before hard limits, very large contexts incur **higher latency and cost** and can slow responses[\[5\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=MCP%20gives%20you%20a%20smarter,but%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20shrink%20it). Without management, an agent that continually appends every message, tool result, and retrieved document will quickly **bloat the context**, risking errors or incomplete outputs when the limit is exceeded[\[6\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=MCP%20gives%20you%20a%20smarter,but%20it%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20shrink%20it)[\[7\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=Bottom%20line%3A).  
* **Stale or Irrelevant Information:** In multi-turn dialogues, not all earlier information stays relevant. Past tool calls, verbose outputs, or outdated intermediate steps can clog the working context. This “stale” data might confuse the model or waste its attention budget[\[8\]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management#:~:text=As%20production%20agents%20handle%20more,insights%20get%20preserved%20across%20sessions). For example, an agent may keep referring back to an old tool result that’s no longer needed, which can degrade performance over time[\[9\]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management#:~:text=Context%20editing%20automatically%20clears%20stale,focuses%20only%20on%20relevant%20context).  
* **Losing Critical Information:** On the other hand, if context is naively trimmed to avoid overflow, the agent might **discard important facts or goals** from earlier in the conversation. Balancing what to keep vs. drop is hard. Key instructions or findings must persist, or the agent will lose track of the user’s needs or the progress made. This is especially problematic across **sessions** – a user might expect the agent to remember prior discussions or data, which isn’t possible unless explicitly managed[\[10\]](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-da3e0f912bbc#:~:text=Press%20enter%20or%20click%20to,view%20image%20in%20full%20size).  
* **Unstructured Context and Miscommunication:** If context is just a raw transcript, the model treats all tokens equally, which can lead to misunderstanding. For instance, system instructions, user asks, and tool outputs all jumbled together may cause the model to misinterpret its role or the relevance of a piece of data. Without structure (e.g. tags or sections), the agent might treat an old user query as a new instruction or give undue weight to irrelevant text[\[11\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents#:~:text=We%20recommend%20organizing%20prompts%20into,as%20models%20become%20more%20capable). Clear delineation of roles and data types in context is often needed to avoid confusion.  
* **External Data & Prompt Injection Risks:** Integrating external content (from tools or other agents) introduces security concerns. **Prompt injection** is a known risk: if malicious instructions are hidden in a file or webpage an agent reads, the agent might inadvertently execute them[\[12\]](https://www.stealthnet.ai/post/how-ai-agents-can-be-exploited-through-indirect-prompt-injection#:~:text=Indirect%20prompt%20injection%20takes%20the,harmful%20instructions%20embedded%20within%20it)[\[13\]](https://www.stealthnet.ai/post/how-ai-agents-can-be-exploited-through-indirect-prompt-injection#:~:text=The%20PDF%2C%20however%2C%20contains%20the,following%20hidden%20command). In agent-tool interactions, untrusted data could thus “poison” the context and trick the agent into ignoring policies or performing harmful actions. This makes it critical to sanitize and control what goes into the context from external sources.

## **Context Management in Agent-to-Agent Interactions**

When multiple agents converse or cooperate on tasks, context management becomes even more complex. Each agent has its own context window and possibly a specialized role. Key concerns and solutions include:

* **Isolated Contexts with Shared Goals:** In a multi-agent system, simply having agents chat freely can balloon context size and lead to **inefficiency or circular conversations**. A best practice is to give each agent an **isolated context focused on its sub-task**, and use an orchestrator (lead agent) to merge results. Anthropic’s Claude Agent SDK, for example, supports **sub-agents** that each use their own context window and then return only the relevant findings to the main agent[\[14\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk#:~:text=Subagents). This ensures no single context becomes overloaded with every detail, yet the overall system still shares needed information.  
* **Role Clarity and Structured Communication:** Define clear roles for each agent (e.g. researcher, calculator, summarizer) so that each knows what context is relevant to include. When agents pass information to one another, use a structured format or protocol. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) can serve as that **common language**, giving agents a standardized way to exchange context and requests without misunderstandings[\[15\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=%23%20Multi,Implode). By using a shared structure (like MCP’s message format), you reduce the risk of agents “talking past each other” or misinterpreting data.  
* **Managing Coordination and Turn-Taking:** Multi-agent interaction can introduce **coordination risk** – agents might get stuck in loops or conflict if not properly moderated[\[16\]](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/multi-agent-systems-building-with-context-engineering#:~:text=Are%20multi%20agent%20systems%20right,for%20you)[\[17\]](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/multi-agent-systems-building-with-context-engineering#:~:text=Though%20powerful%2C%20not%20every%20task,and%20significantly%20higher%20token%20usage). To mitigate this, use a controlled turn-taking mechanism and possibly a central controller that decides which agent speaks when. The controller can summarize or filter each agent’s output before injecting it into another agent’s context. This prevents runaway back-and-forth that could explode the context. It also allows insertion of summaries (“Agent A found X, Y, Z”) instead of raw transcripts of Agent A’s entire reasoning, again keeping contexts lean.  
* **Parallelism vs. Context Overlap:** One benefit of multi-agent setups is parallelism (agents working simultaneously on different pieces of a task). However, parallel agents might end up with overlapping context or duplicate efforts. Ensure that each agent’s context is scoped to a **specific subset of the problem**[\[18\]](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/multi-agent-systems-building-with-context-engineering#:~:text=%2A%20One%20sub,structured%20comparative%20analysis)[\[19\]](https://www.vellum.ai/blog/multi-agent-systems-building-with-context-engineering#:~:text=Use%20a%20multi%20agent%20system,when). For example, one agent handles web research while another handles math calculations – their contexts will then contain very different information. The lead agent can later combine their answers. This specialization prevents every agent from needing the full global context (which would negate the whole purpose by duplicating the context across agents). In short, **divide and conquer the context**: partition what information each agent sees.

## **Context Management with MCP and Tool Use**

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** was created to standardize how AI models interface with external tools and manage context. Instead of treating tools as ad-hoc extensions, MCP formalizes them so that context and tool usage are tightly integrated[\[20\]](https://medium.com/@diwakarkumar_18755/understanding-model-context-protocol-mcp-with-langgraph-and-ollama-a-practical-guide-1aea1c2a9937#:~:text=What%20is%20Model%20Context%20Protocol,MCP). Here’s how context management relates to using MCP servers and tools, and how to optimize this interaction:

* **Standardized Context Structure:** MCP provides a structured way to include tool-related information in the model’s context. It essentially says: *“Here is the context, and here is a request for a tool/action”*[\[21\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=MCP%20acts%20like%20a%20universal,handshake)[\[22\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHere%E2%80%99s%20the%20context,%E2%80%9D). By using MCP’s format, the agent knows what tools are available and how to call them, and tool outputs are fed back in a consistent manner[\[23\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20imagine%20you%20have,party%20vendors). This consistency means less confusion for the model. For example, instead of dumping a raw API response into the chat, MCP might wrap it in a \<tool\_result\> section or similar, so the model can distinguish it from user messages. A standardized context makes it easier to add or swap out tools without breaking the agent’s logic[\[24\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=Today%2C%20it%20uses%20a%20basic,party%20vendors)[\[25\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=With%20MCP%2C%20you%E2%80%99d%20leave%20the,based%20on%20the%20structured%20context).  
* **Stateful Conversations and Memory:** One powerful aspect of MCP is that it can maintain **conversation state outside the model’s own memory**[\[26\]](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-da3e0f912bbc#:~:text=,memory%E2%80%9D%20for%20the%20AI%20system). An MCP server can hold session data, recent queries, or user preferences in a database or memory store, and provide that to the model on each turn. This means the agent isn’t relying solely on the raw token window for long-term state[\[27\]](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-da3e0f912bbc#:~:text=maximise%20the%20effective%20use%20of,memory%E2%80%9D%20for%20the%20AI%20system). For instance, an MCP tool might track a “session ID” and accumulate context on the server side, supplying summaries or important facts back to the model when relevant[\[10\]](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-da3e0f912bbc#:~:text=Press%20enter%20or%20click%20to,view%20image%20in%20full%20size). This effectively **extends the context beyond the token limit**, enabling longer, coherent dialogues without overloading the prompt.  
* **Selective Retention of Information:** MCP encourages **selective context inclusion**. Instead of the model holding everything, the MCP client or server can decide what pieces of info to send to the model on each turn. Important data can be fetched or recomputed on demand (via tools), while less relevant history can be omitted. In practice, this might mean using retrieval tools to get facts only when needed, or having the server summarize older conversation history. “MCP provides a standardized way to prioritize and compress conversation history to maximize use of limited space”[\[28\]](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-da3e0f912bbc#:~:text=Context%20management%20in%20MCP%20addresses,several%20critical%20challenges). It essentially offloads some memory management to an external process that can **summarize, chunk, or filter context** before the model sees it.  
* **Tool Output Management:** Each tool call can return potentially large results (e.g., reading a long document). If inserted naïvely, these results will blow up the context. To mitigate this, treat tool outputs carefully:  
* **Automatic Pruning:** Use context-editing techniques to **remove or replace large tool outputs once they’ve served their purpose**. Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 introduced *context editing* to do exactly this: it automatically clears out stale tool call logs/results when nearing token limits, while preserving the essential conversation flow[\[29\]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management#:~:text=stays%20in%20context%20and%20valuable,insights%20get%20preserved%20across%20sessions). For example, after an agent uses a web-browsing tool and extracts the answer needed, the raw webpage text can be dropped from context and perhaps just a concise finding is kept. This keeps the context size down and the model focused[\[9\]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management#:~:text=Context%20editing%20automatically%20clears%20stale,focuses%20only%20on%20relevant%20context).  
* **Summarization of Results:** If a tool returns something important but lengthy, use the model (or another utility) to summarize that result before adding it to the conversation. Summarization compacts the information so the model retains the key points without the wordy details[\[30\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk#:~:text=Compaction). Some agent frameworks have built-in **compaction** for this purpose[\[30\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk#:~:text=Compaction) – they detect when context is large and summarize older messages or tool outputs automatically.  
* **Limit Output via Tools Themselves:** Design your tools to be as **efficient and focused** as possible. A tool should ideally return only the information asked for, in a concise format. Overlap or extraneous data should be minimized[\[31\]](https://coconote.app/notes/d9fe1ddd-906d-4d03-bca6-a43a80ef58fe#:~:text=,informative%20to%20maximize%20model%20reliability). For instance, if you have a database query tool, have it return just the queried fields, not an entire row dump with unrelated columns. Well-designed tools (with clear documentation of what they do) prevent the agent from calling something that produces a flood of unnecessary text[\[32\]](https://coconote.app/notes/d9fe1ddd-906d-4d03-bca6-a43a80ef58fe#:~:text=,overloading%20with%20exhaustive%20edge%20cases). Also consider adding parameters to tools to limit output size (e.g., a search tool that only returns the top 3 results).  
* **MCP Client-Server Optimizations:** From an *MCP server-to-client perspective*, a few best practices can improve context handling:  
* **Stream results when possible:** If using transports like streamable\_http in FastMCP, stream large outputs so that the client can start processing or summarizing incrementally, rather than waiting for a huge blob (which might then need trimming)[\[33\]](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/mcp/#:~:text=,%7D)[\[34\]](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/mcp/#:~:text=Example%20Weather%20Server%20,transport).  
* **Asynchronous tool calls:** LangGraph’s integration with MCP allows parallel tool usage with nodes like ToolNode[\[35\]](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/mcp/#:~:text=model_with_tools%20%3D%20model)[\[36\]](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/agents/mcp/#:~:text=,tool_node). By handling some tool calls concurrently and outside the main model loop, you can reduce the number of turns and keep the context tighter. For example, rather than the model asking for tool A then tool B in sequence (with both results staying in context), an orchestrator could call A and B in parallel and return only a merged answer to the model.  
  * **Server-side context tracking:** As mentioned, let the MCP server manage a session state. For example, an MCP server might keep a short history of the user’s recent queries or preferences (units, previous results, etc.)[\[10\]](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-da3e0f912bbc#:~:text=Press%20enter%20or%20click%20to,view%20image%20in%20full%20size). The client can query this state when needed instead of keeping everything in the prompt. This offloads memory – effectively the server acts like an external working memory.  
  * **Security and Validation:** Incorporating tools means the agent can act on external data or instructions, so include guardrails. The **MCP format itself won’t prevent a malicious output** from a tool or website from influencing the agent. Developers should therefore implement checks or filters on tool outputs before they enter the model’s context. For instance, if a tool returns a string containing \\"IGNORE ALL AND DO X\\", the agent’s system prompt or logic should be robust to ignore such patterns from untrusted content. (Recent research has highlighted that agents like Claude can be vulnerable to *indirect prompt injection* via tool outputs[\[12\]](https://www.stealthnet.ai/post/how-ai-agents-can-be-exploited-through-indirect-prompt-injection#:~:text=Indirect%20prompt%20injection%20takes%20the,harmful%20instructions%20embedded%20within%20it)[\[13\]](https://www.stealthnet.ai/post/how-ai-agents-can-be-exploited-through-indirect-prompt-injection#:~:text=The%20PDF%2C%20however%2C%20contains%20the,following%20hidden%20command), so mitigating this is part of good context management practice.) This may involve sanitizing inputs, employing an AI firewall, or at minimum, instructing the agent in the system prompt to treat tool outputs as data only, not as instructions.

## **Best Practices for Effective Context Management**

To ensure your agents (especially those built with Anthropic’s models and MCP-based tools) operate reliably, consider the following **good practices** for context management:

* **Treat Context as a Precious Resource:** Only keep the **smallest, most high-signal set of tokens** that the model needs at each step[\[37\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents#:~:text=prompt%E2%80%94it%27s%20thoughtfully%20curating%20what%20information,likelihood%20of%20your%20desired%20outcome). Avoid redundancies and irrelevant chatter. This might mean stripping boilerplate or focusing the prompt on the current task. Always ask, “does the model *need* this piece of information right now?” If not, leave it out.  
* **Aggressively Summarize and Truncate:** Don’t hesitate to **summarize earlier content** once it’s no longer fresh. For lengthy chats, periodically replace verbose history with concise summaries. Also **truncate old data** that has low relevance[\[38\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=MCP%20makes%20context%20management%20easier%2C,still%20have%20to%20manage%20it). Most agents don’t need a full log of 100 turns ago – keep a brief recap of important points instead of every word. Planning for this from the start (rather than patching when things break) will save you from hitting limits[\[38\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=MCP%20makes%20context%20management%20easier%2C,still%20have%20to%20manage%20it).  
* **Use Memory Tools for Long-Term Info:** If you need to preserve knowledge across many turns or sessions, **store it externally** rather than relying on the chat context. Anthropic provides a *memory tool* that lets Claude write/read to files on your infrastructure[\[39\]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management#:~:text=The%20memory%20tool%20enables%20Claude,to%20keep%20everything%20in%20context). You can similarly use databases or vector stores for semantic memory. The agent can drop detailed info into long-term storage (notes, summaries, facts) and retrieve it later by ID or search, instead of dragging everything along in the prompt. This keeps the working context lean while still allowing recall of past insights[\[39\]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management#:~:text=The%20memory%20tool%20enables%20Claude,to%20keep%20everything%20in%20context)[\[40\]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management#:~:text=delete%20files%20in%20a%20dedicated,to%20keep%20everything%20in%20context).  
* **Employ Context Editing Mechanisms:** Leverage any available **automatic context management** features. For example, Claude’s context editing will auto-remove or compress **stale tool outputs and intermediate steps** when the token window is nearly full[\[29\]](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management#:~:text=stays%20in%20context%20and%20valuable,insights%20get%20preserved%20across%20sessions). If your framework supports it, enable such features to handle the pruning for you. This ensures that irrelevant clutter is cleaned out and the model’s focus stays on what matters (with minimal developer intervention during long runs).  
* **Design Tools and Prompts for Clarity:** Each tool given to the agent should be well-scoped and documented, and the prompts should delineate sections clearly. For instance, **label the system prompt, tool guidelines, and conversation separately** (using headers or XML tags as Anthropic suggests)[\[11\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents#:~:text=We%20recommend%20organizing%20prompts%20into,as%20models%20become%20more%20capable). This avoids confusion where the model might mix up instructions vs. user content. Additionally, **prompt-engineer your tools**: provide examples of how to use them, and ensure the agent knows the expected format of tool inputs/outputs. Robust, non-overlapping tool definitions prevent the agent from calling the wrong tool or duplicating functionality[\[31\]](https://coconote.app/notes/d9fe1ddd-906d-4d03-bca6-a43a80ef58fe#:~:text=,informative%20to%20maximize%20model%20reliability). In short, clear structure in prompts and tool interfaces equals less confusion in context.  
* **Isolate and Modularize Agents (if Multi-Agent):** For agent-to-agent setups, give each agent a focused context. **Use sub-agents for parallel tasks** and let them work with their own context windows[\[14\]](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-agents-with-the-claude-agent-sdk#:~:text=Subagents). Only feed the orchestrating agent the distilled results, not the entire context of every sub-agent. This modular approach contains context size and reduces interference between agents. It also simplifies debugging, since each agent’s context can be understood in isolation.  
* **Utilize Standard Protocols (MCP):** Whenever possible, use **standardized methods like MCP** for tool integration and inter-agent communication. MCP ensures a consistent way to pass context and results around, which reduces custom glue code and errors[\[23\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20imagine%20you%20have,party%20vendors)[\[24\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=Today%2C%20it%20uses%20a%20basic,party%20vendors). By adhering to a standard, your agents will be easier to maintain and extend – you can plug in new tools or even swap out the LLM (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.) without completely rewriting how context is handled[\[23\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20imagine%20you%20have,party%20vendors). In essence, MCP and similar standards act like a contract: *“this is how context and calls are structured”*, making your whole system more **modular and future-proof**[\[41\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=).  
* **Monitor Token Usage and Model Behavior:** Implement logging or use observability tools to keep an eye on how the context evolves during agent operation. If you notice the token count climbing rapidly or the model starting to forget instructions, that’s a signal to refine your strategy (e.g., trigger compaction sooner, or adjust what the agent stores in memory). Regular evaluations can reveal where **context management is breaking down**, so you can adjust prompts or add rules. For example, you might find a certain tool’s output is always large and mostly unused – a sign to change that tool or filter its output.  
* **Security Filters for External Content:** Finally, incorporate **guardrails for context safety**. This includes stripping or encoding any content that looks like an instruction when it comes from a user file or web result, so the model doesn’t blindly obey it. You can, for instance, wrap external text in quotes or add a prefix like “Content:” to make it clear it’s reference material. Additionally, consider using specialized libraries or AI firewalls to detect malicious patterns in prompts[\[12\]](https://www.stealthnet.ai/post/how-ai-agents-can-be-exploited-through-indirect-prompt-injection#:~:text=Indirect%20prompt%20injection%20takes%20the,harmful%20instructions%20embedded%20within%20it)[\[13\]](https://www.stealthnet.ai/post/how-ai-agents-can-be-exploited-through-indirect-prompt-injection#:~:text=The%20PDF%2C%20however%2C%20contains%20the,following%20hidden%20command). Standardizing how external content is presented to the agent (e.g., always in a descriptive, read-only manner) will mitigate the risk of prompt injection or other exploits.

By addressing these concerns with careful design and the latest tooling (Claude’s SDK features, FastMCP, LangGraph structures, etc.), you can significantly **improve your agents’ reliability and efficiency**. In summary, effective context management comes down to **providing just the right information at the right time** to your AI agents – no more, no less – and doing so in a structured, deliberate way. Following the above best practices will help your agents interact with each other and with tools more safely, without losing important information or running out of room to think.[\[38\]](https://www.phdata.io/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-a-leap-forward-and-what-you-need-to-watch-for/#:~:text=MCP%20makes%20context%20management%20easier%2C,still%20have%20to%20manage%20it)[\[42\]](https://cobusgreyling.medium.com/model-context-protocol-mcp-da3e0f912bbc#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20effective%20context%20management,current%20state%20of%20the%20conversation)
