## Reference Documentation

**This section is populated when a guide file is referenced via `file:` argument**

### Source Guide
- **File**: [absolute path to guide file]
- **Purpose**: [extracted purpose/overview from guide]
- **Key Concepts**: [list of main concepts from guide]

### Extracted Business Requirements
[Business goals and user value extracted from guide]

**Example**:
- Enable developers to efficiently navigate and understand codebases
- Support impact analysis for code changes with <30 second response time
- Provide dependency mapping capabilities with 95%+ accuracy

### Extracted User Scenarios
[User workflows and scenarios from guide]

**Example**:
1. **Initial Discovery** - Developer searches for all code mentioning a specific function
2. **Dependency Mapping** - Developer needs to understand what code depends on a module
3. **Impact Analysis** - Developer determines what will break if code changes

### Technical Approaches & Patterns
[Implementation patterns, algorithms, and approaches from guide - these inform HOW during planning]

**Example**:
- **Primary Approach**: Three-layer search strategy (Quick ‚Üí Smart ‚Üí Deep)
- **Tools**: ripgrep, grep, find, tree-sitter, ctags, language servers
- **Workflows**: discovery, dependency_mapping, impact_analysis, semantic_search
- **Memory Structure**: Per-file cache + global dependency graph
- **Optimization Techniques**: Bloom filters, parallel search, early termination, smart caching

### Performance & Quality Targets
[Non-functional requirements extracted from guide]

**Example**:
| Operation | Target | Accuracy |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Initial search | < 1 second | 100% |
| Dependency mapping | < 5 seconds | 95%+ |
| Full impact analysis | < 30 seconds | 95%+ |

**Quality Philosophy**: "95% quickly beats 100% slowly"

### Guide Reference for Planning
**IMPORTANT**: This guide file should be consulted during `/plan` and `/tasks` phases for detailed implementation guidance. Each component plan should reference relevant sections of this guide.

**For Planners**: Review [guide file path] sections on:
- [List key sections relevant to planning, e.g., "Smart Traversal Algorithm", "Memory Structure", "Efficiency Tricks"]

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (business value and outcomes)
- üéØ Include WHERE and WITH WHAT CONSTRAINTS (platform, architecture, technical boundaries)
- ‚ùå Avoid detailed HOW implementation (no specific code structure, function names, detailed algorithms)
- üë• Written for both business stakeholders AND technical planners
- üí∞ Budget constraint: <$100/month for all external APIs
- üìä Risk awareness: Identify and score major risks using P√óI√óE
- üîÑ Sequencing: Consider component dependencies for phased delivery

### Business vs Technical Specification Boundary
**DO Include (Platform & Constraints)**:
- Target platform (Claude Code, Python, Kubernetes, etc.)
- Architectural constraints (must use X protocol, integrate with Y system)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, scalability, reliability targets)
- Technology choices that ARE the requirement (e.g., "must be Claude Code command")
- Reference to technical implementation guides (when provided)

**DO NOT Include (Implementation Details)**:
- Specific code structure or class hierarchies
- Detailed algorithm implementations
- Function names or variable naming conventions
- Low-level technical decisions better made during planning

**Note**: When a Reference Guide is provided, technical approaches ARE captured in the Reference Documentation section for planning phase consumption, but they remain separate from business requirements.

## Pain Point Alignment

### Target Pain Points
<!-- Reference: docs/00-project/CUSTOMER-PAIN-POINTS-EXTERNAL.md -->

| Pain Point ID | Description | How This Feature Helps | Impact Score |
|---------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| [ID] | [Description] | [Specific mitigation] | [High/Medium/Low] |

**Pain Point Alignment Score:** [0.0-1.0] (Target: ‚â•0.4) [‚úÖ/‚ùå]

**Calculation:**
- [Pain Point]: Weight=[1-5], Coverage=[0-1], Impact=[1-5] = [score]
- Total Score = (sum of scores) / (sum of weights)

### ROI Analysis (Hours-Based)

| Activity | Current Time | With Feature | Time Saved | Frequency | Monthly Hours Saved |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| [Activity] | [time] | [time] | [time] | [freq] | [hours] |

**Total Monthly Time Savings:** [hours]
**Developer Hour Value:** ~$100/hour (internal estimate)
**Effective Monthly Value:** $[amount]

4. Performance targets from guide become testable acceptance criteria

**Guide File Propagation**:
- This specification includes reference to: [guide file path]
- All component plans should maintain this reference
- Task lists should reference specific guide sections for implementation
